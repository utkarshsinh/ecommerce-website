# E-Commerce Application

## Project Overview

In this project, weâ€™ll build a full-stack e-commerce application from scratch, demonstrating how to create robust and scalable web solutions. As businesses increasingly move online, the demand for full-stack development skills, particularly in building customer-facing e-commerce solutions, continues to grow. This project covers both backend and frontend development, integrating secure payment processing and user management.

### Backend: Spring Boot

Using Java and the Spring Boot environment, we will create a backend that supports:
- Inventory management
- Secure user profiles
- Payment processing with Stripe API
- Administrative panel for inventory management

### Frontend: Vue.js

docker run -it -p 8082:8082 utkarshsinh96/ecommerce-vuejs-ui:v1.0


For the frontend, we will use Vue.js to develop a customer-facing application. Users will be able to:
- View products
- Create and manage wish lists
- Manage their cart
- Checkout using Stripe to complete payments
